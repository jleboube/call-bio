## 🚩 The Problem with Virtual Meeting Introductions

- ⏱ **Time Wasting**  
  5–10 minutes of every meeting are lost to repetitive introductions — especially painful in large meetings.

- 😴 **Meeting Fatigue**  
  Participants lose energy and focus during lengthy introduction rounds before the real meeting begins.

- ❓ **Context Missing**  
  Without proper introductions, participants lack context about each other's roles and expertise.

---
